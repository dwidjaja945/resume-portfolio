# Hi, I'm Dylan Widjaja

## Thanks for visiting my personal site.

This repo houses my personal site where you can read a little about myself, contact me, and even report bugs on my publicly available applications.
It's still currently a work in progress, but I'm adding to it as I find the time.

If you'd like to contact me, please do so either via github, or you can send a message directly to me via my site [here](https://dylanwidjaja.com/contact).

I'm happy to answer questions or help in any way that I can!


Dylan Widjaja
